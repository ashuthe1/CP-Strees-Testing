# Stress Testing Setup for Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains a framework for stress testing solutions to competitive programming problems. It includes a naive solution for generating expected outputs and a checker for comparing outputs.

└── stress_test.sh       # Bash script to run the stress tests
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Bash (for running the script)

## Compiling the Programs

Before running the tests, compile all the necessary programs with the following command:

```bash
g++ solution.cpp -o solution
g++ naive.cpp -o naive
g++ test_gen.cpp -o test_gen
g++ checker.cpp -o checker
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided `stress_test.sh` script to compile all programs automatically.

## Generating Test Cases

Place your input test cases in the `tests/input` directory. You can also modify `test_gen.cpp` to customize the test case generation logic.

## Running the Stress Tests

To run the stress tests, execute the following command:

```bash
./stress_test.sh
```

This script will:
1. Compile all necessary programs.
2. Generate test cases.
3. Run the tests, capturing actual outputs and comparing them with expected outputs.
4. Create logs for each test case in the `logs` directory.

## Viewing the Results

After running the tests, you can check the results:
- Logs for each test case can be found in the `logs/test_logs` directory.
- Logs from the checker can be found in the `logs/checker_logs` directory.

### Example of Log Output

The log files will contain the following information:
- Test case name and pass/fail status
- Input used for the test
- Expected output
- Actual output

Feel free to contribute by adding new test cases, improving the naive solution, or enhancing the checker program.
